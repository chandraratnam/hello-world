# hello-world
Just a basic repository to test syncing with machines and that git is working, before I start pulling down other repos.

The plan for this repo is to test that git is set up properly and that syncing works, before I start syncing other repos.
This is because I will be using library machines which reset on reboot to work on so I want to isntall all my dotfiles and programs to run each time.
